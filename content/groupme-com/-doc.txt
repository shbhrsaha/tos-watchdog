[ TOS Watchdog retrieved from: https://groupme.com/terms ] 

 Simply put: GroupMe, Inc. (collectively, "we" "us" or "GroupMe") is a group 
texting service that lets you stay in touch with groups of people via mobile 
phones. GroupMe is currently provided as a free service. We appreciate 
responsible usage of the service and hope you enjoy it! By the way, if you don't
 agree to the Terms of Service below, don't use the Service!

The following 
terms and conditions govern all use of the GroupMe service including without 
limitation this website (www.groupme.com) (collectively the "Service"). The 
Service is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the
 terms and conditions contained herein, including the provisions calling for 
arbitration of disputes that may arise out of use of the Service, and all other 
operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, GroupMe's Privacy 
Policy http://groupme.com/privacy) and procedures that may be published from 
time to time on this website by GroupMe (collectively, the "Terms").

Please 
read the Terms carefully before accessing or using the Service. By accessing or 
using any part of the Service, you agree to be bound by the Terms. If you do not
 agree to the Terms, then you may not access or use the Service. GroupMe may 
amend the Terms from time to time and will provide notice of any substantive 
changes on this website. Continued usage of the Service constitutes acceptance 
of the amended Terms.

The GroupMe application allows for the purchase of some 
content and services from time to time at the sole option of the user. However, 
there is no requirement or obligation for any user to purchase anything through 
the GroupMe application in order for the user to make use of the Service.

The 
Service is available only to individuals who are at least thirteen (13) years 
old. By using the Service you represent that you are at least 13 years of age 
and otherwise able to enter into a valid and binding legal agreement and 
acknowledge that the Terms constitute a valid, binding agreement between you and
 us.

The Service enables you to create unique groups with friends, coworkers, 
and other individuals and then allows you send messages to individuals you or 
others add to the group. Each unique group is given a ten digit telephone 
number. GroupMe recommends that you go to http://groupme.com/apps and download 
the GroupMe application for messaging. Please note that any text messages sent 
to the unique number will be sent to every individual in the group with the 
exception of commands (always prefaced with a "#").

Consent to add group 
members. GroupMe makes it easy for you to add group members to your groups so 
that you can exchange messages with each other. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO US 
THAT EACH PERSON YOU ADD TO A GROUP HAS CONSENTED TO BE ADDED TO THE GROUP AND 
TO RECEIVE ADMINISTRATIVE MESSAGES FROM GROUPME AND TEXT MESSAGES FROM YOU AND 
ANYONE ELSE IN THE GROUP.

Consent to receive periodic messages from GroupMe. As
 part of the Service, GroupMe sometimes causes administrative messages to be 
sent to members of the group. For example, upon adding a new member to a group, 
such new member will receive a welcome message, instructions on how to stop 
receiving messages, and information on how to avoid certain charges by 
downloading the GroupMe app. GroupMe also may inform group members who have not 
replied that they automatically will be removed from the group if they do not 
participate. GroupMe may send other administrative messages as well. BY SIGNING 
UP FOR THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES FROM GROUPME, AND YOU 
REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EACH PERSON YOU ADD TO A GROUP HAS CONSENTED TO 
RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES FROM GROUPME.

Stopping groupme messages. To permanently 
cease receiving text messages from any group, text STOP to any group or to the 
GroupMe shortcode (GROUP or 47687). GroupMe service can be resumed by texting 
RESUME to any group or the shortcode.

GroupMe does not charge a fee to use the 
Service, but any text messages sent and/or received are subject to standard text
 messaging rates. Additionally, text messages sent and/or received count towards
 a monthly quota as any other messages do. Any users, whether sending or 
receiving text messages with GroupMe, should be aware that standard text 
messaging rates may apply. Please be aware that texting charges can fluctuate 
internationally. Text messaging rates can normally be found by asking your 
provider. If you are using GroupMe internationally, please read our 
International SMS terms, available online here: http://groupme.com/t

This SMS 
Use Policy is designed to prevent fraud and abuse of our subscriptions by a 
small number of users.

GroupMe is primarily intended for use with our 
downloadable application. The ability to send and receive SMS messages is only 
an additive benefit. SMS usage is limited and any usage over 100 messages per 
month may lead to restricted use of SMS, required use of the downloadable 
application and possibly termination of GroupMe SMS capabilities. To maintain 
uninterrupted messaging, it is recommended that you go to 
http://groupme.com/apps and download the GroupMe application for messaging.

IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, 
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. GROUPME DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR 
USEFULNESS OF THE SERVICE, AND YOU RELY ON THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK. ANY 
MATERIAL TRANSMITTED OR STORED THROUGH USE OF THE SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN 
DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS OF
 DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE TRANSMISSION OF ANY MATERIAL THROUGH THE SERVICE. NO
 ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM GROUPME OR

THIS AGREEMENT. SOME STATES MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY 
HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

NEITHER GROUPME NOR OUR 
AFFILIATES, LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES

OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE

LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY UNDER 
THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW 
THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL 
DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION ON CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES MAY NOT 
APPLY TO YOU.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless GroupMe, its 
contractors, affiliates and its licensors, and their respective directors, 
officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses,
 including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the Software and/or 
Service, including but not limited to your violation of the Terms, or your 
breach of any representation or warranty contained in these Terms.

We will not 
be liable to you for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under the 
Terms if the delay or failure is due to circumstances beyond our reasonable 
control.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between GroupMe and you 
concerning the subject matter hereof, and may only be modified by a written 
amendment signed by an authorized executive of GroupMe, or by the posting by 
GroupMe of a revised version. You agree that any notice, agreements, disclosure,
 or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any 
legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in 
writing or otherwise be authorized. There are no third party beneficiaries to 
the Terms. Our failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive our 
ability to act with respect to that circumstance or similar circumstances. If 
any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be 
invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give 
effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other 
provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.

Except to the extent 
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, and except as set forth below under 
the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provision, all disputes arising out of 
or in any way related to this Agreement or the Service shall be brought 
exclusively in state or federal court in New York County, New York. This 
Agreement, and all access to or use of the Service, shall be governed by New 
York law.

You agree that, unless prohibited by applicable law, the parties to 
the Terms may elect to arbitrate - and require the other party to arbitrate - 
any claim arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or the Service.


If you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, neither you nor we will have the 
right to: (1) have a court or a jury decide the claim; (2) participate in a 
class action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative or a 
class member; (3) act as a private attorney general in court or in arbitration; 
or (4) join or consolidate your claim(s) with claims of any other person or 
involving any other transaction.

To start an arbitration, you or we must give 
written notice of an election to arbitrate. This notice may be given after a 
lawsuit has been filed and may be given in papers or motions in the lawsuit. If 
such a notice is given, the claim shall be resolved by arbitration under this 
Arbitration Provision and the consumer or other applicable rules of the American
 Arbitration Administration then in effect using a single arbitrator appointed 
by the American Arbitration Association and approved by you and us. For more 
information please see www.adr.org.

Notwithstanding any language herein to the 
contrary, if you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, neither you nor we will have 
the right to: (1) participate in a class action in court or in arbitration, 
either as a class representative, class member or class opponent; (2) act as a 
private attorney general in court or in arbitration; or (3) join or consolidate 
your Claims with claims of any other person or involving any other transaction, 
and the arbitrator shall have no authority to conduct any such class, private 
attorney general or multiple-party proceeding.

Any arbitration hearing that you
 attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient for you. If 
you cannot afford or otherwise do not want to pay the Administrator's or 
arbitrator's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain
 a waiver of fees from the Administrator, we will consider in good faith any 
request by you for us to bear the cost of those fees. We will pay for our own 
attorneys, experts and witnesses and will pay the reasonable fees and charges of
 your attorneys, experts and witnesses if you win the arbitration, as determined
 by the arbitrator. We will pay any administration fee, arbitration fees and 
fees and charges of attorneys, experts and witnesses if and to the extent we are
 required to pay such fees and charges by law or in order to make this 
Arbitration Provision enforceable.

Any court with jurisdiction may enter 
judgment upon the arbitrator's award. The arbitrator's award will be final and 
binding, except for: (1) any appeal right under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 
U.S.C. ??1 et seq. (the"FAA"); and (2) claims involving more than $100,000. For 
claims involving more than $100,000, any party may appeal the award to a three-
arbitrator panel appointed by the Administrator, which will reconsider anew any 
aspect of the initial award that is appealed. The panel's decision will be final
 and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. The costs of any appeal
 will be borne in accordance with the paragraph above captioned "Location And 
Costs."

This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving 
interstate commerce and shall be governed by the FAA, and not by any state law 
concerning arbitration.

This Arbitration Provision shall survive the 
termination of your use of the Services, the Terms themselves and, the 
fulfillment of all our and your obligations under the Terms*
