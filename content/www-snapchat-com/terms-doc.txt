[ TOS Watchdog retrieved from: https://www.snapchat.com/terms ] 

 We're thrilled you've decided to use our products and services, all of which we 
refer to simply as the "Services."

We've drafted these Terms of Service (which 
we simply call the "Terms") so that you'll know the rules that govern our 
relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese 
from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a 
traditional contract. There's a good reason for that: These Terms do indeed form
 a legally binding contract between you and Snapchat, Inc. So please read them 
carefully.

By using the Services, you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you 
don't agree with them, then don't use the Services.

ARBITRATION NOTICE: WE WANT
 TO LET YOU KNOW UP FRONT THAT THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A 
LITTLE LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT 
ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND SNAPCHAT AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE 
RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND SNAPCHAT WAIVE ANY RIGHT 
TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

No one 
under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. We may offer 
additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older 
to use them. So please read all terms carefully.

By using the Services, you 
state that:

If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other
 entity, you state that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in 
these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity. If 
you are using the Services on behalf of an entity of the U.S. Government, you 
agree to the?Amendment to Snapchat Terms of Service for U.S. Government Users.


Snapchat grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, 
nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the 
Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the 
Service's benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies, such as our
 Community Guidelines, allow.

Any software that we provide you may 
automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You
 may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device's settings.


You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services,
 nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that 
software, unless applicable laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our 
written permission to do so.

Many of our Services let you create, upload, post,
 send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever 
ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a 
license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services
 you use and the Settings you have selected.

For all Services other than Live, 
Local, and any other crowd-sourced Service, you grant Snapchat a worldwide, 
royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, 
display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. 
This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, 
promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.


Because Live, Local, and any other crowd-sourced Services are inherently public 
and chronicle matters of public interest, the license you grant us for content 
submitted to those Services is broader. In addition to the rights you grant us 
in connection with other Services, you also grant us a perpetual license to 
create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, publicly 
perform, and publicly display content submitted to Live, Local, or any other 
crowd-sourced Services in any form and in any and all media or distribution 
methods (now known or later developed). To the extent it's necessary, you also 
grant Snapchat and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual 
right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice solely in Live, Local, 
or other crowd-sourced content that you appear in, create, upload, post, or 
send. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any 
compensation from Snapchat or our business partners if your name, likeness, or 
voice is conveyed through Live, Local, or other crowd-sourced Services.

For 
more information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a 
look at our privacy policy and Support Site.

While we're not required to do so,
 we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any 
reason, including if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone 
though remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or 
store through the Service.

The Services may contain advertisements. In 
consideration for Snapchat letting you access and use the Services, you agree 
that Snapchat, its affiliates, and third-party partners may place advertising on
 the Services.

We always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer 
feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use your ideas without 
compensating you.

Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, 
publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or 
sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or 
organization that submitted it. Although Snapchat reserves the right to review 
all content that appears on the Services and to remove any content that violates
 these Terms, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot?and do 
not?take responsibility for any content that others provide through the 
Services.

Through these Terms and our Community Guidelines, we make clear that 
we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all 
content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to
 our Terms or Guidelines.

Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how we 
handle your information when you use our Services by reading our privacy policy.
 We encourage you to give the privacy policy a careful look because, by using 
our Services, you agree that Snapchat can collect, use, and transfer your 
information consistent with that policy.

Snapchat respects the rights of 
others. And so should you. You therefore may not upload, post, send, or store 
content that:

You must also respect Snapchat's rights. These Terms do not grant
 you any right to:

In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the
 Services in ways that are not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help or 
enable anyone else in doing so.

Snapchat honors the requirements set forth in 
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore take reasonable steps to 
expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become 
aware of. And if Snapchat becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly 
infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to 
terminate the user's account.

We make it easy for you to report suspected 
copyright infringement. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a
 copyright that you own or control, please fill out this form. Or you may file a
 notice with our designated agent:

If you file a notice with our Copyright 
Agent, it must comply with the requirements set forth at 17 U.S.C. ? 512(c)(3). 
That means the notice must:

We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for 
all users. But we can't guarantee it. That's where you come in. By using the 
Services, you agree that:

We also care about your safety while using our 
Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from 
obeying traffic or safety laws. And never put yourself or others in harm's way 
just to capture a Snap.

You are responsible for any activity that occurs in 
your account. So it's important that you keep your account secure. One way to do
 that is to select a strong password that you don't use for any other account.


By using the Services, you agree that, in addition to exercising common sense:


If you think that someone has gained access to your account, please immediately 
reach out to Snapchat Support.

We may offer various virtual goods and services 
(all of which we call "Virtual Products") that you can purchase and use through 
the Services. You don't own these Virtual Products; instead you buy a limited 
revocable license to use them. You'll always be shown the price for Virtual 
Products before you complete a purchase. But Snapchat does not handle payments 
or payment processing for any purchases; those are handled by third-party 
payment providers or service providers (such as, Apple's App Store and Google's 
Play Store, among others). Some third-party service providers may charge you 
sales tax, depending on where you live. Please check the third-party service 
provider's relevant terms for details.

Subject to any applicable additional 
terms and conditions, all purchases are final and non-refundable. And because 
our performance begins once you tap buy and we give you immediate access to your
 purchase, you waive any right you may have under EU or other local law to 
cancel your purchase once it's completed or to get a refund. BY ACCEPTING THESE 
TERMS, YOU AGREE THAT SNAPCHAT IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY 
REASON.

Some of the Virtual Products we offer are for one-time use only, while 
others are for repeated use. But please note that "repeated" does not mean 
"forever." We may change, modify, or eliminate Virtual Products at any time, 
with or without notice. You agree that we will bear no liability to you or any 
third party if we do so. If we suspend or terminate your account, you will lose 
any Products you purchased through the Services.

It's your sole responsibility 
to manage your purchases. If you are under 18 (or younger than the age of legal 
majority in your place of residence), you must obtain your parent's or 
guardian's consent before making any purchases.

Snapchat does not transmit any 
funds and is not a money-services business. To the extent such functionality is 
made available in the Services, it is provided by an unaffiliated third party, 
and like any other third-party service, subject to that third party's separate 
terms of use.

You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for
 using our Services, including text-messaging and data charges. If you're unsure
 what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using 
the Services.

If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used
 to create a Snapchat account, you must update your account information through 
Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages 
intended for you.

If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is 
operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including 
Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party's terms will govern 
the respective party's relationship with you. Snapchat is not responsible or 
liable for those third party's terms or actions taken under the third party's 
terms.

We're relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the 
time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, 
and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of 
these actions at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any 
notice beforehand.

While we hope you remain a life long Snapchatter, you can 
terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.


Snapchat may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, 
and without advanced notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any 
Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the 
Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged 
inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.


Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Snapchat continue to be 
bound by Sections 3, 6, 10, 13-22 of the Terms.

You agree, to the extent 
permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless 
Snapchat, our directors, officers, employees, and affiliates from and against 
any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, 
and expenses (including attorneys' fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in 
any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c)
 your breach of these Terms.

We try to keep the Services up and running and 
free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.

THE SERVICES 
ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE 
SNAPCHAT ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR 
WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY; (B)
 THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR 
IMPERFECTIONS; OR (C) THAT ANY SNAPCHAT CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION 
YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.

SNAPCHAT 
TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, 
ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR 
STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE 
EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE 
INAPPROPRIATE, NONE OF WHICH SNAPCHAT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.

TO THE MAXIMUM 
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SNAPCHAT AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, 
EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY 
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR 
ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY
 LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) 
YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE 
CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES; 
OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF SNAPCHAT
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL 
SNAPCHAT'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED 
THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID SNAPCHAT, IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 
MONTHS.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN 
DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY 
NOT APPLY TO YOU.

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY 
REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH SNAPCHAT, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH 
YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

To the extent the parties are permitted under 
these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Snapchat agree that 
all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of 
the Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court 
for the Central District of California. If, however, that court would lack 
original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all claims and disputes arising 
out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated 
exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. You and 
Snapchat consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.

Except to the 
extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of California, other 
than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any disputes 
arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter, including 
tort claims.

If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that 
provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and 
enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Given the breadth of our Services, 
we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific 
Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be available with 
the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use 
those Services.
