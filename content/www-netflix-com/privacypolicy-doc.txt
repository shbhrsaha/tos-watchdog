Otherwise, Netflix,

We receive and store information about you such as:

We use the

We disclose your information 
for certain purposes and to third parties, as described below:

Whenever in the 
course of sharing information we transfer personal information to countries 
outside of the European Economic Area and other regions with comprehensive data 
protection laws, we will ensure that the information is transferred in 
accordance with this Privacy Statement and as permitted by the applicable laws

Social plugins and social applications are operated by the 
social network themselves, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy 
policies.

In order to provide you with ease of access to your account and to 
help administer the Netflix service, we implement technology that enables us to 
recognize you as the account holder and provide you with direct access to your 
account without requiring you to retype any password or other user 
identification when you revisit the Netflix service. You can choose not to take 
advantage of this feature on your computer by unchecking the box "Remember me on
 this device" when you log in to the website. To remove access to your Netflix 
account from your devices: (a) visit "Your Account", choose "Sign out of all 
devices", and follow the instructions to deactivate your devices (note, 
deactivation may not occur immediately) or (b) delete your Netflix settings from
 your device (steps vary by device and the option is not available on all 
devices). Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at 
the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or Netflix ready 
device, you should log-out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you do 
not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or 
deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your account, 
including your personal information.

If you share or otherwise allow others to 
have access to your account, they will be able to see your information, 
including in some cases personal information, such as your watch history, 
ratings, reviews and account information (including your email address or other 
information in Your Account). This remains true even if you use our profiles 
feature.

Profiles allow different members of your household to have a distinct,
 personalized Netflix experience, built around the movies and TV shows they 
enjoy, such as personalized recommendations and separate watch histories. Please
 note that profiles are freely available to everyone who uses your Netflix 
account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate to and 
use, edit or delete any profile. You should explain this to others with access 
to your account, and if you do not wish them to use or update your profile, be 
sure to let them know.

If you no longer want to receive certain communications 
from us via email, simply access the "Email preferences" link on the "Your 
Account" page of our website and uncheck those items to unsubscribe, or click 
the "unsubscribe" link in the email. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe 
from certain correspondence from us, such as messages relating to your account 
transactions. You can opt in to receive push notifications from Netflix. If you 
subsequently decide you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can 
use your mobile device?s settings functionality to turn them off.

choices regarding cookies set through our website, as well as other types of

We believe we use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial 
measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and

connected devices. These websites and platforms have separate and independent 
privacy or data policies, privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we
 recommend you read carefully. In addition, you may encounter third party 
applications that interact with the Netflix service.

the service, they may do so only with the involvement, supervision, and approval
 of a parent or legal guardian.

We will update this Privacy Statement from time
 to time in response to changing legal, regulatory or operational requirements. 
We will provide notice of any such changes (including when they will take 
effect) in accordance with law. Your continued use of the Netflix service after 
any such updates take effect will constitute acceptance of those changes. If you
