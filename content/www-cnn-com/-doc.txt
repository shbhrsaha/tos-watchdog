 we provide this privacy statement explaining our online information practices 
and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and 
used at this general audience Turner site, and among Turner's network of 
affiliated and operated websites and applications ("Turner Network"), which 
includes any online or mobile sites, applications or services owned, operated or
 offered by or on behalf of Turner or its Affiliates (each a "Site", 
collectively the "Sites"). A representative list of Turner Affiliates is 
available here.

At some Turner Network Sites, you can order products, enter 
contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our
 services such as our online newsletters or text message alerts, or participate

information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail 
address, telephone number, fax number and credit card information.

At some 
Turner Network Sites, you may also be able to submit personally identifiable 
information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name 
and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift 
online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the 
recipient's name and address. Examples of the types of personally identifiable 
information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: 
recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.

At certain 
parts of some of our Sites, only persons who provide us with the requested

we can customize your experience on our Sites. If you agree to such collection, 
you will be able to turn off such data collection at any time by accessing the 
privacy settings of your mobile device and/or through the settings in the 
applicable mobile application.

You also can engage with our content, such as 
video, games, applications, and other offerings, on or through third-party

videos, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts
 or the 'likes' you make, etc.) to deliver the content or as part of the

How We Use the Information

We may 
use the Information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our 
products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our 
offerings, to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may
 be of interest to you, to enforce the legal terms that govern your use of our 
Sites, and/or for the purposes for which you provided the information.

We 
sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you 
when you have won one of our contests, to fulfill a request by you for an online
 newsletter or notification, or to contact you about your account with us.

We 
use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your
 gifts or cards or emails you may wish to send them from our Sites, and for such
 other purposes as may be stated at the point where the information is 
collected.

The information we collect in connection with our online forums and 
communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this 
information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities 
and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, services or customized 
experiences.

If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a letter to
 our editors, comments sent to our television personalities, a posting to a blog
 or a discussion board, a video), we may publish your screen name and other 
information you have provided to us. We may on occasion combine information we 
collect through our Sites with information that we collect from other sources. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if you register and create a 
profile with our Site, the screen name you select as well as other content you 
submit to your profile (e.g., photos, comments, video, reviews) will be 
displayed publicly on the Site and may be reused and redistributed by us in our 
sole discretion, as set forth in our Terms of Use.

We, the Turner Affiliates, 
our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and 
platforms, agencies, or our partners use the Non-Personally Identifiable 
information that is collected to improve the design and content of our Sites, to
 deliver more relevant marketing messages and advertisements, to enable us to 
personalize your Internet experience, and to perform analytics. We also may use 
this information to analyze usage of our Sites or content, as well as to offer 
you products, programs, or services.

When you provide information from your 
social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you 
exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and 
outside our Sites, (3) contact you through the social networking sites or 
directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards, and (4)
 enable you to share your experience and content via social networking sites. By
 doing so, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with our 
privacy statement. When you provide personally identifiable information to us 
through an application, on our Sites, or on social networking sites, it may be 
publicly viewed by other members of these sites and we cannot prevent further 
use of the information by third parties.

We may disclose information we have 
collected from you or the device used to access the Sites in response to legal 
process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may 
disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or 
where we believe in our sole discretion it is necessary to investigate, prevent,
 or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations 
involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of 
our Terms of Use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing 
our Sites and applicable laws or as otherwise required or permitted by law or 
consistent with legal requirements.

In addition, we may transfer information if
 we, or one of our business units, are acquired by, sold to, merged with or 
otherwise transferred to another entity.

Our agents and contractors who have 
access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this 
personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent with this 
privacy statement and are not authorized to use the personally identifiable 
information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are 
performing for us.

We may disclose personally identifiable information and/or 
Non-Personally Identifiable Information to third parties whose practices are not
 covered by this privacy statement. For example, we may share such personally 
identifiable information we collect with our Turner Affiliates to provide, 
improve and communicate with you about their own products and services. A 
representative list of our affiliates is available in the Turner Affiliates 
section below.

We may also share such information with unaffiliated business 
partners and third parties (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, 
retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that want to 
market products or services to you. If a Turner Network Site shares personally 
identifiable information with such unaffiliated third parties, it will provide 
you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses either at the point of 
submission of your personally identifiable information or prior to any such 
disclosure.

If you have signed up to receive our e-mails and prefer not to 
receive marketing information from this Site, follow the "unsubscribe" 
instructions provided on any marketing e-mail you receive from this Site. If you
 have signed up to receive text messages from us and no longer wish to receive 
such messages, you may follow the instructions to stop the delivery of such 
messages, which may include by replying "STOP" to the received text message.


Turner Network Sites covered by this privacy statement may offer content (e.g., 
contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications, or social network 
integrations) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. 
By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally 
identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the 
Site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this 
information. The Site will notify you at the time of requesting personally 
identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such personally 
identifiable information.

To provide visitors with additional or more relevant 
product and service opportunities, to improve and personalize the Sites and to 
perform analytics, and for the additional uses discussed in this privacy 
statement, we may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with the Turner 
Affiliates, third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and
 platforms, agencies, or our partners.

To enhance your online experience, we 
use "cookies" or similar technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your 
computer's browser to store your preferences.

We use cookies to understand Site
 and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or 
advertisements on our Sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your
 experience at our Sites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a 
Site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use 
shopping carts on our Sites. We also may use cookies to help us offer you 
products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver 
relevant advertising.

We, our third party service providers, advertisers, 
advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners also may use 
cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or 
delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or Sites. This 
also helps us, our service providers and partners provide more relevant 
advertising.

The Adobe Flash Player is a powerful application and web tool that
 allows rapid development of highly dynamic content. Sites on the Turner Network
 employ locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash cookies") in 
certain situations where we use Flash to provide special content such as video 
streaming, video on demand, video clips or animation. Flash (and similar 
applications) use this technology to remember settings, preferences and usage 
similar to browser cookies but Flash cookies are not managed through your web 
browser. You can access your Flash management tools from Adobe's website 
directly.

We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising 
networks and platforms, agencies or our partners may also use "web beacons" or 
clear .gifs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a
 Site or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the 
visitors viewing a Site or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count 
the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a 
visitor viewing that Site. Web beacons may also be used to provide information 
on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards,
 etc.).

How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

At this time Sites on the 
Turner Network do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking 
mechanisms, which may include "do not track" instructions. However, you can 
change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar 
technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all 
cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed 
in your browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect your 
online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at
 Turner Network Sites. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for 
more information.

We also use the services of reputable third parties to 
provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and website
 and mobile application analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of 
relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, 
edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, 
advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies and/or partners may 
also place web beacons or similar technologies for these third parties. The use 
of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy 
policies and is not covered by this privacy statement.

Our goal at the Turner 
Network is to provide you with ads that are relevant to you. Advertising enables
 us to provide the rich content for which Sites on the Turner Network are known.
 Often our ads are based on the content of pages you are viewing, but we also 
provide ads tailored to your interests. Our hope is that by presenting ads 
tailored to your interests, we will enhance your experience across the Turner 
Network's diverse Sites. As part of this process we, the Turner Affiliates, our 
third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, 
agencies, or our partners may collect information about your online activities 
across the Turner Network and other sites, and supplement such information with 
information from third parties, in an effort to make inferences about your 
interests and deliver to you advertisements targeted to those interests.

For 
example, if you often visit content on the Turner Network about travel, we may 
use "web beacons" to infer your possible interest in travel and may deliver an 
ad to you related to that interest. It's important to understand that these 
technologies use anonymous identifiers within the "cookies" stored in your 
browser. We offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more 
about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our 
AdChoices page.

Turner's Participation in the Industry Self Regulatory Program 
for Interest Based Ads; Additional Choice Options

Turner is a participant in 
the online industry's self regulatory program administered by the Digital 
Advertising Alliance (the "DAA") and has agreed to adhere to the DAA's 
principles applicable to interest-based ads. Please visit the Self Regulatory 
Program for more information about the DAA, the self regulatory principles and 
choices you can make regarding interest-based ads.

You may also find more 
information about entities involved in online advertising and additional choices
 you may make through the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") at the NAI 
site.

The tools provided on the Ad Choices page, as well as the DAA opt-out 
page and the NAI opt-out page are provided by third parties, not Turner. Turner 
does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and 
others provide through these tools.

We, our third party service providers, 
advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our partners may 
also be collecting identifiers designed to enable advertising on your mobile 
device. However, depending on your device, you may be able to reset your mobile 
device's advertising identifier at any time by accessing the privacy settings on
 your mobile device. In addition, when using a mobile application you may 
receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for 
Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, 
provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-
application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the 
privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of 
tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating 
systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact 
the applicable platform operator.

Some of our Sites contain links to or 
integrations with other sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., whose 
information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the 
other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is 
submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

Turner operates globally so
 it is necessary to transfer your information internationally. In particular, 
your information will likely be transferred to and processed in the United 
States where many of our central databases operate. The data protection and 
other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may not be as 
comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we take 
reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using this Site 
you consent to your information being collected, used and transferred as set 
forth in this privacy statement.

We have put in place appropriate physical, 
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized
 access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we 
collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the 
information that we collect and store.

Although we take appropriate measures to
 safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you
 that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be 
disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy statement.
