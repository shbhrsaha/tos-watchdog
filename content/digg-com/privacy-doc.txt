 Ad Settings or Google Analytics' opt-out tools.

Digg mobile applications (iOs 
and Android) use Localytics for demographic and interest-based information. You 
may wish to read Localytics? privacy policy and/or use their opt-out service.


Digg uses Chartbeat in order to measure engagement and help us make decisions 
about features or products we offer. If you would like to opt-out, you can 
delete some cookies from your browser as described in the Charbeat Privacy 
Policy.

Digg uses Quantcast for information on Internet traffic statistics and 
demographic data. If you do not wish to participate, you may adjust your setting

We automatically receive and record information 
from the Digg application or your web browser when you interact with Digg, 
including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used to 
facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with Digg (e.g., what 
content you have clicked on).

Generally, Digg automatically collects usage 
information, such as the number and frequency of users accessing Digg, Digg 
features and applications, and its various streams of content. We may use this 
data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner 
that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and 
third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of 
Digg so that we can analyze and improve them.

Cookies are pieces of text that 
may be provided to your computer through your web browser or application when 
you access a website or service. Your browser stores cookies in a manner 
associated with each website or service you visit. We use cookies to enable our 
servers to recognize your web browser or Digg application and tell us how and 
when you visit and use Digg through the web or through an application.

Digg 
cookies also allow us to track when you have accessed content through Digg. Each
 access is tracked using a unique identifier assigned to you in one or more 
cookies stored by your web browser or application and associated with Digg.


Digg cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not 
combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal 
Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to 
identify that your web browser or application has accessed content through Digg 
and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.

This 
Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of 
cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place 
cookies on your computer or device. For example, third party websites may set 
their own cookies.

We collect statistical information about how people use Digg
 ("Aggregate Information"). Some of this information is derived from Personal 
Information, such as your location (which, in turn, can be derived from your IP 
address or through location based services used by your device). This 
statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to 
you, your Account, your web browser or your Digg application.

Digg is designed 
to help you share information that you or people you choose to follow locate on 
the web. As a result, much of the information generated through Digg is shared 
publicly or with third parties. All Digg content is public. We may also 
distribute content and feeds through an email digest to users who have elected 
to receive such email digests.

Your activity on the Digg network is public by 
default and can be located by or distributed to anyone, although certain 
activity and information can be made private through your Account settings page 
(such as your Digg Deeper/Top Twitter stories, Digg Reader feed, items that you 
digg, and your Saved items). Individuals reading the aforementioned information 
may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and 
without your knowledge. Therefore, we urge you to think carefully about how you 
configure your Digg settings, and what actions you take on Digg.

In addition to
 reviewing this Privacy Policy, you should also review the terms of service and 
privacy policies of any Third Party Services that you access through Digg. Digg 
respects the privacy settings/policies that you have selected with Third Party 
Services, and only shares information consistent with those privacy settings and
 policies.

You may otherwise access Third Party Services through Digg, for 
example by accessing curated content. We are not responsible for the privacy 
policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible
 for reading and understanding those privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only 
governs information collected on or through Digg.

User profile information, 
including the display Name you select, the username you choose to use on Digg, 
avatars or images you elect to upload and other information you enter on your 
profile (such as your bio), may be displayed to other users to facilitate user 
interaction within Digg. Email addresses, Twitter, Facebook, and/or Google 
account name will not appear on your public profile unless you enter it in the 
bio area yourself.

We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service 
providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of
 statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people 
use Digg and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their 
services and how we interface with them. In addition, these third parties may 
share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information 
about you that they have independently developed or acquired.

We employ and 
contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf
 and who are under our control (our "Agents"). We may need to share Personal 
Information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. 
Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal
 Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to
 assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our 
Agents.

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of 
transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business 
assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets associated with 
Digg, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or 
enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is 
transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers 
may occur, and that any acquirer of us may continue to use your Personal 
Information as set forth in this policy.

We also reserve the right to access, 
read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is 
necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or 
governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Service, including 
investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or 
otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user 
support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and 
the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and 
organizations for fraud protection and spam prevention.

Except as set forth 
above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with 
third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

If 
you sign up for The Daily Digg email via the Digg website or in any other Digg 
application, you will receive an email once daily highlighting some curated or 
other content on Digg. If you sign up for Digg Deeper/Top Twitter email alerts 
or a daily summary email of your Digg Deeper/Top Twitter stories, you may select
 frequency and/or timing of such emails through your settings page.

Regardless 
of whether you decide to receive the above mentioned email alerts, you may 
occasionally receive from us email and other communication relating to your 
Account. These emails will only be sent for important purposes, such as password
 recovery or important communications regarding Digg services and/or features.


We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this 
confirmation to improve email deliverability and/or our customer service. You 
may wish to read the policy for use of cookies and other technologies used by 
Sailthru, our email provider. If you do not wish to receive emails from Digg, 
you may unsubscribe from individual email communications through your settings 
page, or click the unsubscribe link in any email to cease all further email 
correspondence from Digg.

Facebook, Google or other third-party logins) is protected for your privacy and

Information by selecting and protecting your passwords appropriately and 
limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have 
finished accessing your account.

ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any

guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to

accessible to the public. If you would like us to remove such stored
