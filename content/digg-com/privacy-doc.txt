What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This 
Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information 
("Personal Information") we gather when you are using or accessing Digg. This 
Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our 
business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.


This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do 
not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, 
content sources, services and applications ("Third Party Services") that you 
elect to access through Digg, or to individuals that we do not manage or employ.
 While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that 
share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the 
content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to 
carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.


What Information Is Collected by Digg?

The information we gather enables us to 
personalize, improve and continue to operate Digg. In connection with certain 
aspects of Digg, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal 
Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.

When
 you create an Account or login using your Twitter, Facebook, and/or Google 
credentials, you will provide information that could be Personal Information, 
such as your username, password and email address. You acknowledge that this 
information may be personal to you, and by creating an account with Digg and 
providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to 
identify you and therefore may not be anonymous. We may use your contact 
information to send you information about our Services, including without 
limitation, notifications regarding the Services and, upon your request, email 
digests of content shared by those that you follow on Digg, Twitter, Facebook, 
and/or Google. You may unsubscribe from these messages through your Account 
settings, although we regardless reserve the right to contact you when we 
believe it is necessary, such as for account recovery purposes.

Digg allows you
 to provide content to Digg, such as the ability to digg and Submit collections 
of content and uniform resource locators ("URLs"), written descriptions of 
content or URLs, comments, text, images and video. We may also collect and store
 information regarding the content in your Digg, Twitter, Facebook, and /or 
Google feeds and the original URL, and associate that information with your 
Account. We also collect and store (i) the time and date on which the content 
was first dugg, submitted, or shared and (ii) information on the channels 
through which the content was shared, e.g., to other Digg users, Twitter 
followers, Facebook friends, and/or Google connections.

We share certain 
information about you, such as your username, any avatar or image you elect to 
post, your Twitter, Facebook, and/or Google username, your reading feeds through
 Digg, Twitter, Facebook, Google, and other Third Party Services, and other 
information you elect to make public to your followers in Digg, your followers 
on Twitter, your friends on Facebook, and/or your connections on Google. This 
may include Personal Information, but only to the extent that you decide to 
share such information with others.

We may retain content submitted by you to 
Digg indefinitely, even after you terminate your Account.

If you are a Digg 
Reader user, we will maintain information about the sources and subscriptions, 
including RSS and other content feeds, that you choose to follow. We will 
collect and store (i) all articles and posts that are part of your subscribed 
feeds, (ii) data associated with those items, such as the time and date they 
were published, (iii) whether and when you viewed, saved, or marked them as 
read, (iv) information related to your organizational choices, such as the 
folders or tags you assign to sources, and (v) information necessary to complete
 actions you may choose to take with particular items, such as digging, saving, 
liking, recommending, or sharing to Third Party Services.

We collect 
information about accesses of content curated through Digg, as well as 
interactions with Digg Reader. This information includes, but is not limited to:
 (i) the IP address and physical location of the devices accessing the curated 
content or interacting with Digg Reader; (ii) the time and date of each access 
or interactions; and (iii) information about sharing of curated content or 
content appearing in Digg Reader.

Some features of Digg allow you to share your
 Digg curated content and Digg Reader content through Third Party Services, as 
well as your content from Third Party Services through Digg. If you choose to 
connect Digg to such Third Party Services, we may collect information related to
 your use of those Third Party Services, such as authentication tokens that 
allow us to connect to your Third Party Service accounts. We may otherwise 
collect information about how you are using Digg to interact with those 
connected Third Party Services. Note that Third Party Services may have the 
ability to restrict the information that is provided to us.

Digg uses Google 
Analytics, an analytics service provided by Google, Inc. We use Google Analytics
 Demographics and Interest Reporting which gives us access to approximate 
demographic and interest information of visitors to digg.com. This information 
is used to improve the features of digg.com. You can manage your settings for 
Google Analytics and opt-out of this feature by visiting Google.com Ad Settings 
or Google Analytics' opt-out tools.

We automatically receive and record 
information from the Digg application or your web browser when you interact with
 Digg, including your IP address and cookie information. This information is 
used to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with Digg 
(e.g., what content you have clicked on).

Generally, Digg automatically 
collects usage information, such as the number and frequency of users accessing 
Digg, Digg Reader, and its various streams of content. We may use this data in 
aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that 
would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third 
parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of Digg 
so that we can analyze and improve them.

Cookies are pieces of text that may be
 provided to your computer through your web browser or application when you 
access a website or service. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated 
with each website or service you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to 
recognize your web browser or Digg application and tell us how and when you 
visit and use Digg through the web or through an application.

Digg cookies also
 allow us to track when you have accessed content through Digg. Each access is 
tracked using a unique identifier assigned to you in one or more cookies stored 
by your web browser or application and associated with Digg.

Digg cookies do 
not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the 
general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to
 tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your
 web browser or application has accessed content through Digg and may associate 
that information with your Account if you have one.

This Privacy Policy covers 
our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. 
We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer or 
device. For example, third party websites may set their own cookies.

We collect
 statistical information about how people use Digg ("Aggregate Information"). 
Some of this information is derived from Personal Information, such as your 
location (which, in turn, can be derived from your IP address or through 
location based services used by your device). This statistical information is 
not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account, your web 
browser or your Digg application.

How and To Whom Is My Information Shared?


Digg is designed to help you share information that you or people you choose to 
follow locate on the web with others. As a result, much of the information 
generated through Digg is shared publicly or with third parties. All Digg 
content is public. Your activity on the Digg network is public and can be 
distributed to anyone that follows you. We may also distribute content and feeds
 through an email digest to users who have elected to receive such email 
digests.

Some of your activity on and through Digg is public by default. This 
includes, but is not limited to, URLs that you have "dugg" or URLs submitted to 
Digg. Individuals reading this information may use or disclose it to other 
individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. 
Therefore, we urge you to think carefully about these actions.

In addition to 
reviewing this Privacy Policy, you should also review the terms of service and 
privacy policies of any Third Party Services that you access through Digg. Digg 
respects the privacy settings/policies that you have selected with Third Party 
Services, and only shares information consistent with those privacy settings and
 policies.

You may otherwise access Third Party Services through Digg, for 
example by accessing curated content. We are not responsible for the privacy 
policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible
 for reading and understanding those privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only 
governs information collected on or through Digg.

User profile information 
including your username, avatars or images you elect to upload and other 
information you enter may be displayed to other users to facilitate user 
interaction within Digg. We will not directly reveal users' email addresses to 
other users.

We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service 
providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of
 statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people 
use Digg and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their 
services and how we interface with them. In addition, these third parties may 
share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information 
about you that they have independently developed or acquired.

We employ and 
contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf
 and who are under our control (our "Agents"). We may need to share Personal 
Information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. 
Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal
 Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to
 assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our 
Agents.

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of 
transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business 
assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets associated with 
Digg, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or 
enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is 
transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers 
may occur, and that any acquirer of us may continue to use your Personal 
Information as set forth in this policy.

Information Disclosed for the 
Protection of Us and Others:

We also reserve the right to access, read, 
preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to
 (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental 
request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Service, including investigation of 
potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, 
security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) 
protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes 
exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud 
protection and spam prevention.

Information We Share With Your Consent:

Except
 as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be 
shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this 
information.

If you sign up for The Daily Digg email via the Digg website or in
 any other Digg application, you will receive an email once daily highlighting 
some curated or other content on Digg.

Regardless of whether you decide to 
receive The Daily Digg, as part of Digg, you may occasionally receive from us 
email and other communication relating to your Account. These emails will only 
be sent for important purposes, such as password recovery.

We may receive a 
confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve
 email deliverability or our customer service.

Is Information About Me Secure?


Your Account information (including your Twitter, Facebook, Google or other 
third-party logins) is protected for your privacy and security. You need to 
prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by 
selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your
 computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your 
account.

We endeavor to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept 
private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any Account information. 
Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may 
compromise the security of user information at any time.

We otherwise store all
 of our information, including your IP address information, using industry-
standard security techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that such 
techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you we store, 
Personal Information or otherwise.

What Information of Mine Can I Access?

You 
can access information associated with your Account by logging into the web 
version of Digg, or through the Digg application. You can adjust settings and 
privacy preferences through your Account settings.

Registered and unregistered 
users can access all of the above information.

How Can I Delete My Account?


Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by visiting 
digg.com/settings or by visiting Account Settings in the Digg mobile 
application. If you terminate and delete your Account, any association between 
your Account and information stored by, or in connection with, Digg will no 
longer be accessible. However, given the nature of sharing using Digg, any 
public activity on your Account prior to deletion will remain stored on our 
servers and will remain accessible to the public. If you would like us to remove
 such stored information, please send us an email at support@digg.com.

What 
Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?

As stated previously, you can opt 
not to disclose certain information to us, even though it may be needed to take 
advantage of some Digg features.

You can delete your Account or adjust your 
Account's privacy settings. Please note that we will need to verify that you 
have the authority to delete the Account, and activity generated prior to 
deletion will remain stored by us and may be publicly accessible.

What Happens 
When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?

We may amend this Privacy Policy
 from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy 
Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the
 way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an 
announcement on or within Digg or sending you an email. A user is bound by any 
changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses Digg after such changes have 
been first posted.

What If I Have Questions or Concerns?

If you have any 
questions or concerns regarding privacy using Digg, please send us a detailed 
message to: support@digg.com. We will make every effort to resolve your 
concerns.
